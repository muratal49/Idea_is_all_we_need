Idea Is All We Need: An AI-Enhanced Research Discovery Tool
Description
 This project aims to build an AI-driven tool that helps researchers quickly search, organize, and extract insights from academic literature. By leveraging advanced NLP models like BERT, LDA, and GPT-4, the system enables users to identify emerging topics, uncover research gaps, and generate new ideas efficiently.
The project connects to the CORE academic research database via API to pull full-text papers and metadata, followed by topic modeling, semantic search, and question-answering over retrieved content. The goal is to accelerate literature reviews and enhance scientific creativity.

🔥 Features
📄 CORE API Integration: Search and download academic papers by keywords, subjects, or DOI.


🧠 Topic Modeling: Discover main themes across papers using LDA.


🔍 Semantic Search: Retrieve papers based on deep semantic meaning using BERT embeddings.


❓ Question Answering (QA): Extract answers from papers to user queries (trends, gaps, future directions).


⚡ Automated Paper Summarization: Quickly extract key sections like future work, limitations, and conclusions.



🛠️ Technologies
Python (requests, pandas, nltk, gensim, transformers)


CORE API v3


BERT and Sentence Transformers


Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)


GPT-4 for QA (optional)
